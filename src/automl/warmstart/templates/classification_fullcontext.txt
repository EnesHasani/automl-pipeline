You are assisting me with automated machine learning using [MODEL] for a [TASK] task. The [TASK] performance is measured using [METRIC].
The dataset has [NUM_SAMPLES] image samples with dimensions of [IMAGE_SIZE]. Class distribution is [CLASS_DIST].
The pixel mean is [PIXEL_MEAN] and pixel standard deviation is [PIXEL_STD].
Iâ€™m exploring a subset of hyperparameters detailed as: [CONFIGURATION_AND_TYPE].

Provide [NUM_RECOMMENDATION] diverse and efficient configuration suggestions to commence a Bayesian Optimization procedure aimed at fine-tuning hyperparameters.
Your proposals will be used as the mena of the prior distributions of the parameters.
These configurations should be carefully customized to suit the characteristics of the dataset at hand. The dataset description is: [DESCRIPTION].
Your response should include only a dictionary, where each key is a hyperparameter and its value is the proposed mean of prior distribution for that hyperparameter.
The dictionary should be wrapped with curly brackets {}.
Here is an example of the response format:
{
    "lr": 0.01,
    "scheduler_gamma": 90,
    "scheduler_step_size": 200,
    "weight_decay": 0.0001,
}
